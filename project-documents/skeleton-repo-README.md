## Core project: git-github | Skeleton repo

**Primary objectives targeted: 1, 2**

Additional suggested objectives: 3, 4, 5

See additional guidelines for demonstrating [Objective 1 (Workflow)](http://d2m-r.github.io/assessment/misc/workflow-assessment.html) and [Objective 2 (Git/GitHub)](http://d2m-r.github.io/assessment/misc/gh-assessment.html) on the course site.

## Description

In this project, you will create a new “skeleton” GitHub repo. The repo can either be just to practice organizing and working in GitHub or as a setup for an actual project you’re going to work on (other than your integrative data project). 

*Note:* By its very nature, this mini-project cannot be completed with a GitHub Classrooms assignment.

## Instructions

1. In the method of your choosing, create a github repo connected to an R Project. Both the repo and project should be created for this project, though you can set it up planning ahead to use it as a functional repo beyond this submission.
    1. You may create the repo in the D2M-R organization or as a private repo. Working in the D2M-R org is recommended in most cases, but if this is the start of a project you intend to continue beyond the class you should create the repo through your account outside the class org.
2. In your local repository (i.e., your R Project), create a “skeleton” for the real or imagined research project. The skeleton should include all files and/or directories required for any repository and should *not* include files and/or directories that should not be stored or shared remotely. Create and organize  files and directories that may not be required in all repositories, but are either necessary or useful in this repo.
    1. Refer to the Git/GitHub slides for information about required and recommended elements of a repo.
3. As you work, use git best practices for version control, including frequent, informative commit messages. In the file(s) created for the purpose of documentation, keep descriptions, file trees, and any other information up-to-date.

It you use this just for practice (vs. prepping for a real, planned project), you can make up a pretend project to structure the repo around, which does not have to be realistic. Feel free to use *lorem ipsum* text and other filler material for anything non-essential, or to go wild with details about your fictional project.

*Note:* If you are following the instructions as written and committing/pushing frequently, there’s a good chance you’ll come across an issue where your local and remote repos don’t seem to sync perfectly as you’d expect. If you encounter this issue, it’s your responsibility to identify what is going on and address it. 

While there’s always a chance you’re dealing with something actually going wrong, there are some things you’re likely to encounter that aren’t bugs, they’re features! “Solving” the problem isn’t fixing a bug, it’s adapting your work to function the way you want it to within the system.

### Challenge suggestions

To show a more advanced mastery of core skills, try one or more of the following:

1. If your skeleton mimics a research project, it should be centered on a single Quarto manuscript (.qmd). Try incorporating advanced markdown, Quarto extensions (like apaquarto, used in D2M-R II), or other post-processing tools (like the `papaja` package).
2. Your repo can be organized for something other than a research project, like an R package, github pages website, or dissertation with multiple embedded projects. Be sure that it still includes all the essential components that should be in all repos of any kind, and that the repo’s documentation clearly explains its purpose.
3. Some objectives are more straightforward to demonstrate than others. Get creative in how you show us the skills you’re practicing, but remember that your ultimate submission should just be the repository. For example, one way to meet some learning objectives is taking screenshots of the setup process, then putting them somewhere in the repo itself (sensibly organized!). 
4. Use the dummy documents in this repo to programming or tidyverse skills. This project is ideal for demonstrating *any* of the core objectives at *any* level, because you have full flexibility over what to include in your repo’s scripts and notebooks.

## Submission

Detailed submission instructions are included in the `core-submission.qmd` document and the [GitHub Submissions Guidelines](http://d2m-r.github.io/assessment/misc/gh-submissions.html). 

Reminders:

1. Copy the `core-submission.qmd` doc from `student-hub/templates` into the top level of your repo and complete in full. 
2. Ensure you create a *private* repo. Invite all instructors as collaborators with Write+ permissions.
3. Initiate a `feedback` branch and pull request.
4. Your work is not submitted until you have completed the [Submission Form](http://d2m-r.github.io/submit.html).
