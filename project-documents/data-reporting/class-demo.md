## Core-project: Data reporting | Topic Demo

**Primary core objectives targeted: 1, 2, 12**

Recommended additional objectives: whatever you want to do the demo about!

## Submission

This project should be completed in a dedicated GitHub repository, either in the D2M-R organization or your private account. There is not a GH Classroom option for this project.

Detailed submission instructions are included in the `core-submission.qmd` document and the [GitHub Submissions Guidelines](http://d2m-r.github.io/assessment/misc/gh-submissions.html). 

Reminders:

1. Copy the `core-submission.qmd` doc from `student-hub/templates` into the top level of your repo and complete in full. 
2. Ensure you create a *private* repo. Invite all instructors as collaborators with Write+ permissions.
3. Initiate a `feedback` branch and pull request.
4. Your work is not submitted until you have completed the [Submission Form](http://d2m-r.github.io/submit.html).

This project is designed to be completed by an individual in a Quarto notebook. However, it is extremely flexible. **If you would like to take on this project in a group or a format other than Quarto notebooks (or even something outside a repository structure entirely!), email Dr. Dowling** to discuss the best way to go about it.

## Description

In this project you will create a Quarto notebook that demonstrates and teaches a core concept from our course curriculum, or an “off-the-syllabus” skill relevant to the course. 

You do not need to share your notebook with other students, but you should design the demo with your classmates as the intended audience, as though you were going to step in to lead class for a day.

That said, if you are proud of your work and would like to share it with others, please do! 

## Instructions

1. Choose one core topic from the course curriculum, such as:
    - Data wrangling with tidyverse
    - Visualizing continuous data with ggplot2
    - Creating tables with gt/gtExtras/kable
    - Using Git/GitHub branches and pull requests
    - Factor manipulation with `forcats`
2. Create a Quarto notebook (.qmd) that includes:
    1. YAML header (minimally with a title and output format)
    2. Introduction to the topic
    3. Sensible logical organization
    4. Effective use of markdown for presentation
    5. Textual (i.e., in the markdown) explanations of concepts
    6. Code chunks with examples
3. Successfully render your notebook to HTML format with a cohesive visual style
    1. Be sure your demo would run for a hypothetical student (use relative paths!)

## Challenge suggestions

Extend your project with these optional enhancements:

1. Convert your notebook into an alternative format, like Quarto presentation slides, a simple Quarto website (not necessarily published; RStudio can render a full website locally!), or an APA-formatted document.
2. Make your demo/lesson more engaging by including interactive elements like embedded videos/animations, Shiny interaction, and html & css styling.
3. Complete your demo’s GitHub repository with README documentation, example data files, etc.
4. Instead of a “walkthrough” style demo, create a “guided exercise” style demo, like the leveled data cleaning, wrangling, and data reporting projects. If you go this route, you should include both the student version (without code/answers) and the instructor version (the key with working code and answers).
5. Develop complementary materials, like a cheat sheet or reference table.
