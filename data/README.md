# Datasets

This directory contains example datasets for use in assignments and practice exercises.

## Available Datasets

Each dataset includes: 

- The data file(s)
- A README or documentation file[^1] explaining the dataset structure, source, and any relevant context

[^1]: At least in theory. In reality, follow-through on good documentation here is probably going to be rough.

## Usage

Students can download these datasets directly or reference them in their analysis scripts. 

Datasets are added by instructors for in-class demos and practice exercises, but students
are free to add datasets to share with others.

## Adding New Datasets

When adding a new dataset, please include:

1. The dataset file(s) (CSV, TSV, RData, etc.)
2. A README or documentation file, named similarly to the dataset file (e.g., `my-dataset-README.md`), that includes at least:
    1. Information about data source and any licensing
    2. Description of variables/columns
    
Use *pull requests* to contribute new datasets or update existing ones:

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your dataset and documentation
3. Submit a pull request for review, including a description of the dataset and its intended use
4. Instructors will review and approve contributions
